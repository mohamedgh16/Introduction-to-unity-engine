### Introduction
Unity engine is one of the strongest engines in game development and it's one of the easiest engines that would help a programmer begin his journey in the gaming development industry. In this tutorial, we will explain the interface of the engine and understand how to create different objects, manipulate them and compose them together, we will also use prefabs to enhance the ability to reuse and edit different objects.

### Table of contents
- Understand the engine interface
- Create edit and compose objects
- Understand the reusability of prefabs

### Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, youâ€™ll need the following:
- A basic understanding of the C# programming language.
- A basic understanding of classes and objects in the C# programming language.
- Have a unity engine installed on your system.

**Note** that we will not use the C# language directly in this tutorial, but understanding it will be helpfull with unity objects and later on when coding is needed.

If you don't have the unity engine installed on your system, you can click [here](https://unity.com/download) to download it and install it.

### Unity version and updates
In order to make a new project, you need to pick a unity version (latest version is recommended), after that you need to pick your modules. In this tutorial, we will only need the *WebGL Builed Support* module, click on done and it will be downloaded and installed. ![Webgl](https://github.com/mohamedgh16/Introduction-to-unity-engine/blob/main/Webgl.png).

### Unity interface


### Unity objects


### Prefabs















### Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have learned all the functionalities of the unity engine interface, we have also understood how objects operate and how we can create them, manipulate them, and use them in different fields inside the world of the game. Finally, we have learned about prefabs and how we can reuse the same work instead of repeating it multiple times. Don't forget to try out the examples yourself to fully understand how they work.
