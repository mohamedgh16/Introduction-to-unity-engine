### Introduction
Unity engine is one of the strongest engines in game development and it's one of the easiest engines that would help a programmer begin his journey in the gaming development industry. In this tutorial, we will explain the interface of the engine and understand how to create different objects, manipulate them and compose them together, we will also use prefabs to enhance the ability to reuse and edit different objects.

### Table of contents
- Understand the engine interface
- Create edit and compose objects
- Understand the reusability of prefabs

### Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, youâ€™ll need the following:
- A basic understanding of the C# programming language.
- A basic understanding of classes and objects in the C# programming language.
- Have a unity engine installed on your system.

**Note** that we will not use the C# language directly in this tutorial, but understanding it will be helpfull with unity objects and later on when coding is needed.

If you don't have the unity engine installed on your system, you can click [here](https://unity.com/download) to download it and install it.

### Unity version and updates
In order to make a new project, first you open the unity hub, then you need to pick a unity version (latest version is recommended), after that you need to pick your modules. In this tutorial, we will only need the *WebGL Builed Support* module, click on done and it will be downloaded and installed.

### Create a new project
Using the unity hub, click on projects then click on new. In this tutorial we will work on a 3D template, click on 3D, name the file and choose a place to save your project on your computer.

### Unity interface
At first sight, you may think that the unity interface looks complicated, but after understanding each part of it it will be simpler to you. We will describe the main parts of the interface and explain how they work togather later on in this tutorial.

#### Hierarchy
The Hierarchy will contain all the objects created in your game, it can store all kind of objects, from standalone objects to composed objects.

#### Scene
The scene will show us the planes and the game objects that we create and use in the game, it's also the main tool in unity because it helps us minipulate move and duplicate the objects that we have in order to make a perfect composed object.

### Inspector
The inspector contains all kinds of information about any created object, from logical information to physical information, it also allows editing these information from the inspector instead of editing them from the scene wich is harder sometime or even imposible for some data. If you need to know any infromation about any object, simply click on it.

### Unity objects
In this tutorial we will be creating a simple car from composing many objetcs, let's begin by creating our first object. Right click on the Hierarchy, click on 3D object then click on cube, Now a cube will appear on your screen inside the Scene, try moving around the cube by clicking alt + left click and try zooming and and out using the middle mouse button, you maype also hold on your middle mouse and move your hand to move freely on the planes of your scene and objects. All the previous movments will come in handy when working on your objects.

### Prefabs















### Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have learned all the functionalities of the unity engine interface, we have also understood how objects operate and how we can create them, manipulate them, and use them in different fields inside the world of the game. Finally, we have learned about prefabs and how we can reuse the same work instead of repeating it multiple times. Don't forget to try out the examples yourself to fully understand how they work.
