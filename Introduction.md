# Introduction
There is an increasing popularity of smart contracts every day and Web3 developers are in high demand. However, the Subgraph development area is still untouched and the demand is really high.

The average hourly rate of a freelancer Subgraph developer is $90-150/hour. You can make Subgraph development your career and a Subgraph dev your official title! It is just amazing how many new titles and careers Web3 has created the last two years.

At the time of writing this course, we have a total of 15889 Subgraphs on the [hosted service](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/), and 372 Subgraphs on [Mainnet](https://thegraph.com/explorer). That just tells you how many dApps are currently relying on The Graph, and how The Graph is the backbone of Web3.

All of your favorite Web3 dApps are already using The Graph. Some examples are: [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Ethereum Name Service](https://ens.domains/), [Pooltogether](https://pooltogether.com/), and [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/).

### What is The Graph?
The Graph (aka. Google Of Blockchains) is a protocol that gives dApps the ability to retrieve data from blockchains easily in a decentralized manner.

Before The Graph, dApps had to build their own data solutions to go through every single event emitted by their contract(s) and save the data locally, then build a software to filter that data.

Some of the problems you will face if you use a similar approach:
1. Since you are using your own servers. If they go down, your dApp will be out of service. This is the single-point-of-failure that centralized companies are currently facing. Even if you have the best hardware and software, how many times do Facebook, YouTube, and other big-name companies suffer outages? As an example, Discord and Spotify went down on March 8, 2022, [*Source*](https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/spotify-discord-outage-google-cloud). The Graph mainnet is fully decentralized and has a lot of independent indexers running their own servers to secure the network and serve your queries all over the world.

2. Not cost-efficient or time-efficient since you need to actively maintain the servers. Therefore, you are wasting your time and money on this instead of focusing on the value additions your dApp brings to web3.

If you want to learn more about how The Graph actually works, I recommend reading:
1. [The Graph Network In Depth - Part 1](https://thegraph.com/blog/the-graph-network-in-depth-part-1)

### When do you need to use The Graph?
After learning about the problem, let's talk about the solution.
The Graph allows you to build custom open APIs called "Subgraphs". Subgraphs are used to tell indexers (server operators) which data to index on a blockchain and save on their servers in order for you to be able to query it at any time using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). 

The Graph is a powerful tool that supports relationships between entities, filters, aggregations, and a lot more.

The Graph has 2 networks:
1. Mainnet - This is the decentralized network and currently only supports ETH mainnet. Other chains are going to be added soon.
2. The Hosted service - This is the beta product, free to use, and will sunset at some point in the future. It supports the following chains:
- ETH mainnet. Kovan, Rinkeby, Ropsten, and Goerli testnets as well.
- Poa-core, and Poa-sokol.
- Near mainnet and testnet.
- Polygon, and Mumbai.
- Fantom.
- BSC, and Chapel.
- Clover.
- Avalanche, and Fuji.
- Celo, and Celo-alfajores.
- Fuse.
- Moonriver.
- Mbase.
- Arbitrum-one, and arbitrum-rinkeby.
- arbitrum-one, and arbitrum-kovan.
- Aurora, and Aurora testnet.
The Graph is also [working on](https://thegraph.com/blog/multiblockchain-support) supporting other chains like Solana and Polkadot soon.

If you want to build an API to retrieve data from a blockchain, The Graph is the best choice for you.

### Diagrams to understand The Graph

#### Computing time

-- Insert Diagram-1.jpg here --

The top bar represents a blockchain, where all the data exist. The bottom bars represent Subgraphs, so you actually don't need to spend computing time to go through the entire blockchain, to go through irrelevant information.

#### Computed at run time vs pre-computed 

-- Insert Diagram-2.jpg here --

Imagine you want to know the total number of all NFTs sold in a day. Without a Subgraph, you would have to gather all NFT transfer events and which can take a lot of time. A Subgraph will be updated as the events occur so the data is readily available, and ready to be queried at any time.

#### Transaction volume

-- Insert Diagram-3.jpg here --

If you look at the rate at which the number of transactions is increasing on the Ethereum mainnet, you will notice that it is parabolic rather than linear. This means that each day the blockchain becomes quadratically harder to grab data from. 

That is what The Graph solves. It keeps your application quick, reliable, censorship-resistant, and decentralized.


### Prerequisites
To follow along with this course, you need to have:
1. Some knowledge of GraphQL. I recommend [this course](https://www.howtographql.com/).
2. You need to understand how events work. There are multiple tutorials on YouTube but it is easier if you read the [Ethereum EIPs](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/tree/master/EIPS), like [ERC20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md), and [ERC721](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md).
3. Some TS/JS experience.

Even if you are a beginner, don't worry, we are going to break down everything for you.

### Software requirements
You need to have the following installed on your computer:
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Any IDE. I prefer [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
3. The Graph CLI. Once you have `npm`, install the Graph CLI by running: 

```bash
npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli
``` 

The above command is for Windows users. If you are using a Mac/Linux, you have to use: `sudo npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli`

### Goal
After completing this course, you are going to be able to build and deploy your own GraphQL API to index any Blockchain.

Check out the Subgraph we are going to build in this course [here](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/ahmadmardeni1/grttoken2).

You will also get a certificate after passing all the quizzes!

That's all for this introduction! Before starting your journey as a Subgraph developer with us, join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/7UDxeZ56JK) and say gm in the #gm(link to the channel) channel! 
Under SUBGRAPH-DEVELOPMENT-COURSE you will find some channels where you will be interacting with other developers, asking your questions, and submitting the assignments of this course.
